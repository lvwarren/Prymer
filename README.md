Van Blazing Fast Python Primer Featuring Jupyter Notebook Quick Reference

Dear Esteemed Colleagues -

One of the things that hinders new students of Python in their journey is setting up the environment. Doing this for any programming language, is half the battle. It is very true for Machine Learning, but this primer is also good for new students and professionals alike who need to get going fast, without fuss.

This functioning notebook includes standard Python actions as well as symbolic algebra examples, so one can span the gap between numerical and symbolic computing.

To run it select Tools-->Restart and Run all.

I developed this quick reference and placed it here on github and mirrored in Google colab so that anyone with the link can have instant access to a functioning Jupyter Notebook running basic Python as a quick reference guide that is also a living document. Do you like running sentences?

It is my belief that by practicing the basics over and over again, we can come to think, live and breathe in the languages we are expressing new ideas and there has never been a better time.
